This book provides a clear plan for success after the end of a relationship. It is the culmination of my own experience as someone
getting over a breakup. The material here is the core of how I turned the most
devastating breakup into the best thing that ever happened to
me-and how you can, too.

When people leave you, it's easy to make the

that somehow, because they no longer want

nothing to do with you. Maybe it just means
they no longer get your spirit, and so their part

From The Writer &nbsp:&nbsp  I wanted to help people change their lives and tell them that anything was possible. I eventually went to a counsellor to get a good piece of guidance but instead, I got what isn't necessary. In doing some research and joining grief groups, I saw the profound healing and positive effect that working through grief had on people. Whether it was from the breakup, a divorce, a death, or a sudden change, people who faced their grief changed in amazing ways.

<p align="justify"> After I ended my first love, I wanted to help people change their lives and tell them that anything was possible. I eventually went to a counsellor to get a good piece of guidance but instead, I got what isn't necessary. In doing some research and joining grief groups, I saw the profound healing and positive effect that working through grief had on people. Whether it was from the breakup, a divorce, a death, or a sudden change, people who faced their grief changed in amazing ways.One day someone asked me if I had made all my dreams come true. I said I had, but the answer bothered me for days because
there was one dream of mine that had not been fulfilled. I was now in it, it seemed that, at the oddest times, someone would share with me their story of a breakup or someone they knew who was trying to leave an abusive situation. I would feel compelled to share my story, and each time I did, people encouraged me to keep telling it and helping others. Each time I tried to put it away, something would happen that would coax it back out, and someone would say I had to keep telling my story to give hope to others who were in similar situations. I first started a page to answer e-mail and questions from random people though it worked well still I wasn't getting that completed feeling. Somewhere in my heart, it was saying that I'm lacking somewhere, I'm not getting that hearty smile though it was temporary. Page readers have grown and developed into a wonderful support community; members talk privately and often share different experience and
sometimes they ask for advice or give us the way how they dealt it . New visitors to the page are typically experiencing a lot of distress and are warmly welcomed into the community. My friends and readers asked me for a book to lay out the road map to healing. So I compiled this book to share my journey and some of my knowledge. Mine was a very devastating breakup that was the catalyst for the wonderful life I have now-something I wish for everyone and fervently believe everyone can achieve. For anyone experiencing a breakup: men or women, gay or straight, secular or spiritual, young or old. Grief is a universal emotion and there are concrete steps to move beyond it that apply to everyone. This book is for anyone who wants to know how to get over the loss and move on to a full and happy life. It's hard but it happens. And it hurts. You love someone who may have loved you once upon a time. Or who acted like there was a possibility of love in return, but now there's not. Or who simply doesn't feel the same way and isn't
going to feel the same way. Maybe your ex seemed to love you deeply, too. And then he or she just switched off and hurt you in ways that were unimaginable at the height of your mutual love.Maybe someone new came along and your ex left. Friends tell you that you are better than this new person in every way. But your ex is still with Mr. or Ms. New Thing. You seethe because this new person is a snake in the grass and your ex doesn't see it. This new person is immature, unavailable, spoiled, or just plain stupid. And your ex is enthralled nonetheless. What? Or maybe there is no one else and nothing else. Your ex just fell out of love one day. Or failed to fall in love on the day you did. That's even more baffling. Wait. You're choosing nothing over me? What? Or maybe your ex has spiraled into some other mind-set. He or she is depressed, upset, self-absorbed in some way. Don't you want someone to help carry the burden? you ask. The answer you get is Please leave me alone. You're freaking out. How is it that he or
she wants you to help by going away? What? Maybe you initiated the breakup. Maybe your ex did. Whatever the situation, you're left with a big pile of hurt. And it really hurts. You go over your exchanges repeatedly in your mind. Where did it go wrong or fail to go right? What should you have done that you didn't? What did you do that you shouldn't have? You feel rejected and "less than." You feel as if there is something really wrong with you. You wonder what you could do to make this person want you. Stop right there.
Forget about changing for someone else. Forget about bargaining for what you should have without bribing whatever deity you believe in. Forget about losing yourself just so this narrow-minded person will love you. Forget it! You deserve better-much better. While the aftermath of a breakup or some loss can be a devastating time, it can also be a tremendous opportunity for life-changing growth. As unbelievable as it may seem when you are in the throes of
heartache, this can be a rich and fertile time when you are most open and ready to make your dreams come true. A breakup can actually be a liberating time when you take charge of your life and make positive change happen-instead of waiting around for it to happen to you. During the post-breakup period, you have three options. The first is to spend all kinds of time, futile effort, and tears trying to win back your ex. The second is to try to go on as if nothing has happened and continue down the same path that led you into yet another unsuccessful relationship. The third option is to heal properly, look at what's happened, and learn new ways to put together a healthy and whole life. Not only will this make you happier, it will also give you the best chance to find true love with a person who is good for you and to you. Although the last option is infinitely more attractive and assures sustained long-term happiness, most people choose the first, and when that doesn't work, the second. Why? Because they have no idea how to do the third-to take charge of their lives.
Over the years I've met many friends and people who want meaningful change in their lives after a breakup but don't
know how to make it happen. One friend said to me, "Since my Breakup , I find myself at a crossroads in life, but I don't know which way to go." Another friend of mine thought ending his life would be the best? But she dropped the idea. She said"I want to do things now, but I'm still in pain from the breakup and the choices seem overwhelming."
When you are part of a couple, there is a certain rhythm of life combined with accountability to the relationship that precludes other choices. Once the relationship is over and those constraints no longer exist, you have a unique chance to assess your array of new options and decide what you want out of life, where you're going, and how you are going to get there. But being bewildered and afraid may keep you paralyzed. Did you jump into your last relationship to escape something else? This opportunity you now have is not only about life choices but also about your emotional condition. After a breakup, many people who seek therapy or go to support groups discover that there's a part of themselves that have been unhealed for a very long time. One friend told me, "I stuffed all of my bad memories from previous abuse while I was with my boyfriend. The minute the relationship ended, the memories returned. She could not outrun her pain." Another friend said" Later I became clingy and whiny in relationships and tried to avoid any loss at all". Perhaps you have had smaller losses, a move or something small, that you've never fully recognized as something to grieve. Perhaps you have never really experienced a significant loss and this breakup is a first for you. Whether you have unresolved grief or not, learning to work through loss is one of the most healthy things you can do. Emotional pain has an upside-it can motivate you to examine certain aspects of your life in a way that doesn't happen when you are comfortable. The new breakup pain coupled with old, unresolved grief can bring you to a place where you can address issues and recover-in a way you're not able to do when you're not facing a major loss.
Opportunity plus willingness means that this breakup is the best time to change your life for the better, inside and out. Unfortunately, few people take the opportunity because after the first blush of freedom, the reality of being alone begins to overshadow the promise of change. The emotional pain becomes so great that willingness to work through it is replaced with a drive to "feel better" and put everything in the past. Even if you have every intention of getting past the breakup, both emotionally and logistically, it may seem like an impossible task because life alone seems scary and unclear. Your insecurities may take over; you may feel unattractive or dread that you will be alone the rest of your life. You may begin to doubt the soundness of your decisions and plans. Maybe you've always wanted to go back to school, take up a new hobby, or move somewhere else, but suddenly this feels self-indulgent and ridiculous. Your self-esteem may plummet as you become immobilized by indecision. You may backpedal on your plans for a new life because it's terrifying to venture forth to unfamiliar places. The push to a new relationship or the pull back to the old one-or just sitting and waiting until something comes along- may begin to take hold. Getting into another relationship or losing your resolve to change your life is not going to make anything better-it's just a temporary panacea. In fact, a new relationship will probably behave as last one because you haven't learned anything, nor have you worked through the pain of the breakup. Putting your hopes and dreams on hold will not extinguish them; it will just fill you with regret at the end of the next relationship that you didn't get going on them sooner. Right now, the best thing to do is to meet this challenge head-on, work through your grief, make those plans, and change your life. So how do you do that when you're overcome by grief, fear of the future, and practical everyday matters? If you think it's very hard to do without direction, you're absolutely right.</p>
